Personal IaC playbook for setting up a home media server. This is my first IaC project, so it's going to be a bit rough around the edges, I wouldn't recommend using this for anything other than inspiration or especially using it anywhere exposed to the internet.  
Feel free to open an issue if you have a recommendation or question, or if you spot some glaring issue I've missed.
